# Testing Strategy

## Overview
Comprehensive testing approach to achieve 80%+ code coverage.

## Testing Levels

### Unit Tests
- Component-level testing
- Function and method testing
- Mock dependencies
- Fast execution

### Integration Tests
- API endpoint testing
- Database integration
- Service communication
- External dependencies

### End-to-End Tests (Optional)
- User journey testing
- Browser automation
- Complete workflow validation

## Testing Tools

- **Jest**: Unit testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing
- **Supertest**: API testing
- **Playwright/Cypress**: E2E testing
- **Coverage**: Istanbul/NYC

## Coverage Goals

- **Minimum**: 80% overall coverage
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage
- **Integration Tests**: 70%+ coverage
- **Critical Paths**: 100% coverage

## Setup Instructions

1. Install testing dependencies
2. Configure test environment
3. Write test cases
4. Set up coverage reporting
