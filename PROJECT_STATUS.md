## ðŸ”„ Branch Management Strategy

### Main Branches
1. **`feature/local-mysql-setup`** - Stable web development implementation
   - Keep this branch untouched for presentations
   - All web development requirements are met
   - Ready for demonstration

2. **`software-architecture-implementation`** - Architecture course work
   - All new architecture-related changes
   - Infrastructure and DevOps implementations
   - Documentation and testing enhancements

### Workflow
```
feature/local-mysql-setup (STABLE - Web Dev Course)
    â†“
software-architecture-implementation (ACTIVE - Architecture Course)
    â†“
feature/docker-setup
feature/kubernetes-deployment
feature/jenkins-pipeline
feature/monitoring-setup
etc.
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Start with Containerization
```bash
# Create Dockerfile for the application
# Set up docker-compose for local development
# Test containerized application
```

### 2. Kubernetes Deployment
```bash
# Create K8s manifests
# Set up local cluster (minikube/kind)
# Deploy application to cluster
```

### 3. CI/CD Pipeline
```bash
# Install and configure Jenkins
# Create Jenkinsfile
# Set up automated builds
```

## ðŸš€ Success Strategy

1. **Keep web dev branch stable** - No changes to `feature/local-mysql-setup`
2. **Incremental architecture implementation** - One component at a time
3. **Document everything** - Each step with screenshots and explanations
4. **Test thoroughly** - Ensure each component works before moving to next
5. **Regular commits** - Clear commit messages for each architecture component

## ðŸ“ž Support and Resources

- Base application is fully functional and tested
- All web development requirements are met and stable
- Architecture implementation can build upon solid foundation
- Clear separation of concerns between the two courses
